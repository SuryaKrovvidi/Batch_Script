# Batch_Script

A simple Batch script to compile and execute a Java program writing a single line on the console. 

How to use:
1) Download the 'run.bat' file and place it in your current working directory.
2) Type 'run.bat MainClassName argumentlist(if any)' and hit Enter.

Example:
Let the main class name be Sum and We have to pass two integers as command line arguments.
I'll type 'run.bat Sum 3 4' in the command prompt.
If everything is fine we get the output. Otherwise, errors will be displayed.

Pay attention to the comments in the batch file to know how the script works.

P.S. Though it's not a groundbreaking improvement, it does help at times.
